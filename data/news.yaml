  content: "Excited to announce Mirror Duality in Convex Optimization, which is the joint work with Prof. Asuman Ozdaglar and Chanwoo Park at MIT EECS and Prof. Jelena Diakonikolas at UW-Madison CS. This paper provides a novel perspective on gradient reduction in the mirror descent framework for Banach spaces, and we hope this work opens the door to interesting questions on gradient reduction algorithms."
