          <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2025.05** &nbsp; Two papers ([Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06768), [LoRA theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09376)) are accepted at ICML 2025, both as oral presentations! (Top 1.0%). <br><br>
          <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2024.09** &nbsp;  I’m starting my Ph.D. at Harvard University, prospectively advised by Prof. [Sitan Chen](https://sitanchen.com/) and [Sham KaKade](https://shamulent.github.io/). I’m really thrilled to pursue my research career at Harvard University! <br><br>
          <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2024.08** &nbsp; I'm honored to be selected as Ilju Foundation scholarship, which supports graduate students studying abroad. <br><br>
          <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2024.04** &nbsp; Excited to announce my new paper, [Optimal Acceleration for Minimax and Fixed-Point Problems is Not Unique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13228) (ICML 2024, Spotlight, Top 3.5%). By proposing novel algorithms, we suggested that the optimal acceleration mechanism in minimax optimization and fixed-point problems is not unique. Surprisingly, our new algorithms are **H-dual** to the prior anchor-based accelerated methods: We discover H-duality in other setups! <br><br>
          <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2023.12** &nbsp; I attended [NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023) and gave a poster presentation. <br><br>
