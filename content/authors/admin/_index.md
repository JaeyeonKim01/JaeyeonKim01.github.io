 Hello, my name is Jaeyeon Kim! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at Harvard CS, prospectively advised by [Sitan Chen](https://sitanchen.com/) and [Sham Kakade](https://sham.seas.harvard.edu/).

 My academic journey started in junior high school, with multiple awards in [Math Olympiads](https://rmms.lbi.ro/rmm2019/index.php?id=results_math). Since then, I've always been driven by solving challenging problems with mathematics. Afterward, I studied Mathematics at Seoul National University, where I received B.S. in Mathematics. I loved to organize mathematical concepts in my own words--also I got 4.3/4.3 in every math course that I've taken! 

  Fortunately, I worked with Prof. Ernest Ryu in Optimization Theory. 


Feel free to reach me!
