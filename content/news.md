        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2024.09** &nbsp; I'll start my Ph.D. at **Harvard University**, prospectively advised by Prof. [Sitan Chen](https://sitanchen.com/). I'm really thrilled to pursue my research career at Harvard University! <br><br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2024.08** &nbsp; I'm honored to be selected as Ilju Foundation scholarship, which supports graduate students studying abroad. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2024.04** &nbsp; Excited to announce my new paper, [Optimal Acceleration for Minimax and Fixed-Point Problems is Not Unique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13228) (ICML 2024). By proposing novel algorithms, we suggested that the optimal acceleration mechanism in minimax optimization and fixed-point problems is not unique. Surprisingly, our new algorithms are **H-dual** to the prior anchor-based accelerated methods: We discover H-duality in another setups!   <br><br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2023.12** &nbsp; I attended [NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023) and gave a poster presentation. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2023.11** &nbsp; Excited to announce [Mirror Duality in Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17296), which is the joint work with MIT EECS and UW Madion CS. This paper provides a novel perspective on gradient reduction in the mirror descent framework for Banach spaces, and we hope this work opens the door to interesting questions on gradient reduction algorithms. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2023.09** &nbsp; [H-duality paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/4947292b9f5e7d4ab792fa35537f8b96-Abstract-Conference.html) is accepted at NeurIps 2023. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2023.07** &nbsp; I attended [ICML 2023](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023), and gave an oral presentation (Top 3 papers) at the Workshop: [Duality Principles in Modern Machine Learning](https://dp4ml.github.io/papers/). <br><br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2023.07** &nbsp; I started a research internship under Prof. [Asuman Ozdaglar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GcuxcLYAAAAJ&hl=en). We hope to extend H-duality, which is presented in my paper, into various settings. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2023.05** &nbsp; [My first paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06628) is uploaded in Arxiv! This is the joint work with MIT EECS. This work presents a new duality principle: H-duality, a duality between optimization algorithms for reducing function values and reducing gradient magnitude. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first instance of a duality of optimization algorithms. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2022.09** &nbsp; I joined the Optimization Research Group led by Prof. [Ernest Ryu](https://ernestryu.com/) as a research intern.  <br><br>
    #    <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2021.12** &nbsp; I won a gold medal in the Korean Mathematics Competition for Undergraduate Students. <br><br>
    #    <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2021.10** &nbsp; I'm in third place in the pair section of the Simon-Mararis Mathematics Competition, with Taeyeong Noh. <br><br>
   #     <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2020.12** &nbsp; I won a gold medal in the Korean Mathematics Competition for Undergraduate Students. <br><br>
   #     <i class="fa-regular fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; **2019.02** &nbsp; I won a silver medal (11th place) in the Romanian Masters of Mathematics.
