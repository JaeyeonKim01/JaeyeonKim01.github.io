        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2023.12] &nbsp; I attended NeurIPS 2023 and gave a poster presentation. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2023.11] &nbsp; Excited to announce Mirror Duality in Convex Optimization, which is the joint work with Prof. Asuman Ozdaglar and Chanwoo Park at MIT EECS and Prof. Jelena Diakonikolas at UW-Madison CS. This paper provides a novel perspective on gradient reduction in the mirror descent framework for Banach spaces, and we hope this work opens the door to interesting questions on gradient reduction algorithms. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2023.09] &nbsp; H-duality paper is accepted at NeurIps 2023. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2023.07] &nbsp; I attended ICML 2023, and gave an oral presentation (Top 3 papers) at the Workshop: Duality Principles in Modern Machine Learning. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2023.07] &nbsp; I started a research internship under Professor Asuman Ozdaglar. We hope to extend H-duality, which is presented in my paper, into various settings. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2023.05] &nbsp; My first paper is uploaded in Arxiv! This is the joint work with Chanwoo Park and Asuman Ozdaglar of MIT. This work presents a new duality principle: H-duality, a duality between optimization algorithms for reducing function values and reducing gradient magnitude. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first instance of a duality of optimization algorithms. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2022.09] &nbsp; I joined the Optimization Research Group led by Professor Ernest Ryu.  <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2021.12] &nbsp; I won a gold medal in the Korean Mathematics Competition for Undergraduate Students. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2021.10] &nbsp; I'm in third place in the pair section of the Simon-Mararis Mathematics Competition, with Taeyeong Noh. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2020.12] &nbsp; I won a gold medal in the Korean Mathematics Competition for Undergraduate Students. <br><br>
        <i class="fa-thin fa-newspaper"></i> &nbsp; [2019.02] &nbsp; I won a silver medal (11th place) in the Romanian Masters of Mathematics.
